# Lab 10: Accessible JavaScript

## Overview

Enhance JavaScript functionality to ensure keyboard-only users can navigate menu items using the arrow keys. Implement the roving index technique to manage focus:

## Focus the new element.

    Set tabindex of focused element to 0.
    Set tabindex of previous element to -1.

## Testing

    Use the keyboard and Chrome DevTools to test the functionality.
